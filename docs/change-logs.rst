Incompatible issues
-------------------

* Incompatible of the ``license.lic``

   **v6.0.1**

   The license file generated by this version doesn't work with the old
   obfuscated scripts. There are 2 solutions for this case, still generating the
   license file with old version pyarmor, or obfuscating the scrips again by new
   version pyarmor.

   However ``license.lic`` generated by old version still works. That is to say,
   even all the scripts are obfuscated by new version, you need not issue new
   license file to customers, because the previous license file still works.

* Incompatible of the obfuscated scripts

   Generally obfuscate part of scripts by new version, then overwrite the old
   scripts obfuscated by other version, it still works.

   Except the following versions:

   **v6.3.0**

   The scripts are obfuscated by this version and later, can not mixed with the
   ones obfuscated by ealier version. All the scripts must be obfuscated again
   and replace the old runtime files with new ones.

6.8.1 (pre-release)
-------------------
* Fix issue (#571): In Linux super mode with `--enable-suffix` doesn't work

  The dev version could be installed by this command::

6.2.0
-----

In this version, **super mode** is introduced to improve the security.  In this
mode the structure of PyCode_Type is changed, and byte code or word code is
mapped, it's the highest security level in PyArmor. There is only one runtime
file required, that is extension module :mod:`pytransform`, and the form of
obfuscated scripts is unique, no so called :ref:`bootstrap code` which may make
some users confused. All the obfuscated scripts would be like this

.. code:: python

    from pytransform import pyarmor
    pyarmor(__name__, __file__, b'\x0a\x02...', 1)

It's recommended to enable this mode in suitable cases. Now only the latest
Python versions are supported:

* Python 2.7
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8

It may support Python 3.5, 3.6 later, but Python 3.0~3.4 is out of plan.

* Add new option `--obf-mode`, `--obf-code`, `--wrap-mode` to command `obfuscate`
* Add new value 2 for option `--advanced` to enable super mode, refer to :ref:`using super mode`
* Fix multiprocessing issue: `ValueError: __mp_main__.__spec__ is None` (#232)
* The command `runtime` will generate default protection script `pytransform_protection.py`
* Add new option `--cross-protection` to command `obfuscate` to specify customized protection script
* The default cross protection code will not be injected the entry script if
  `--no-runtime` is specified as obfuscating the scripts. In this case, use
  option `--cross-protection` to specify one protection script
* Change the default capsule location from `~/.pyarmor_capsule.zip` to
  `~/.pyarmor/.pyarmor_capsule.zip`
* Add new functions `get_user_data`, `assert_armored` in runtime module `pytransform`
* Document `how to store runtime file license.lic to any location <https://pyarmor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html#storing-runtime-file-license-lic-to-any-location>`_
* Remove the trailing dot from harddisk serial number, it may impact the license verified.

6.1.0
-----
* Add external plugin script `assert_armored.py`
* Enhance the command `licenses`:
   - The final argument could be empty, for example, `pyarmor licenses` will
     generate a default license to `licenses/pyarmor/license.lic`
   - If the output is end with `license.lic`, it will not append any other path,
     just save it as it is. For example, `pyarmor licenses -O dist/license.lic`
     will save the final output to `dist/license.lic`
   - Add new option `--fixed`, and document `how to use this option to improve
     the security`_
* In command `pack`, the default license will be generated with `--fixed` to
  improve the security

.. _how to use this option to improve the security: https://pyarmor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html#binding-obfuscated-scripts-to-python-interpreter

6.0.2
-----
* Refine the obfuscated code object to improve security
* Refine plugin code to make it clear
  https://pyarmor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to-do.html#how-to-deal-with-plugins
* Add internal plugin `assert_armored` and document basic usage
  https://pyarmor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html#checking-imported-function-is-obfuscated

6.0.1
-----
* Fix restrict mode 3 bug: the obfuscated script crashes or complains of this
  error: `This function could not be called from the plain script` (#219)
* Fix bug: the obfuscated script raises unknown opcode error when the script is
  obfuscated by `obf_code=2` if there is recursive function call
* Fix command `init` and `config` bug: the entry script is set to `.` other than
  empty when passing ``--entry=""``
* Fix bug: the traceback will print very long line if the obfuscated script
  raises exception
* Fix bug: in some special cases the obfuscated scripts which are obfuscated
  with ``--enable-suffix`` still conflict with other obfuscated packages
* Refine the error message as violating restrict mode
* The obfuscated script will raise exception `RuntimeError` other than quit
  directly when something is wrong
  **Now it will print a pretty traceback to find where is the problem**
* When generating `license.lic` for the obfuscated scripts, the license version
  information will be embedded into the license file implicitly
* Do not transfer exception type to `PytransformError` as pyarmor initializes
  failed

**Upgrade notes:**

The license file generated by this version doesn't work with the old obfuscated
scripts. There are 2 solutions for this case:

* Still generating the license file with old version pyarmor
* Or obfuscating the scrips again by new version pyarmor

5.9.8
-----
* Fix restrict mode 3 bug: the obfuscated function failed if it's called from
  generator function even in the obfuscated script.
* In pack command it will try to use the encoding `coding: xxx` in the first
  comment line of `.spec` file

5.9.7
-----
* Fix pack issue: it will raise `UnicodeDecodeError` when the source path
  includes non-ascii characters(#217)
* Fix obfuscate issue for Python2: it will raise `UnicodeDecodeError` when the
  source path includes non-ascii characters
* Refine pack command: it will print the output of PyInstaller to the console
  either

5.9.6
-----
* Refine pack command. Now it's easy to pack the obfuscated scripts with an
  exists `.spec` file, just specify it by ``-s``, refer to
  https://pyarmor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html#bundle-obfuscated-scripts-with-customized-spec-file

5.9.5
-----
* Change the plugin search policy, do not support enviorment variable
  `PYARMOR_PLUGIN`, but search folder `plugins` in the pyarmor package path.
* Add a new path `plugins` in the package source, there are several common
  plugins. So it's easy to check internet time by this way::

      pyarmor obfuscate --plugin check_ntp_time foo.py

  Before that both of these lines should be inserted into ``foo.py``::

      # {PyArmor Plugins}
      # PyArmor Plugin: check_ntp_time()

* Fix pack bug: `pyi-makespec: error: unrecognized arguments: -y` if
  extra options are passed
* Document command `pack` in details:
  https://pyarmor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man.html#pack

5.9.4

-----
* Fix bug: the command `pyarmor runtime --platform alpine.x86_64` raises error (#201)
* Fix bug: the platform `linux.armv6` doesn't work in Raspberry PI Zero W,
  rebuild the dynamic library with `-march=armv6 -mfloat-abi=hard -marm`

5.9.1
-----
* Python debugger and profile tool could work with the plain python
  scripts even if the obfuscated packages are imported. Note that the
  obfuscated scripts still couldn't be traced.
* Refine `pack` command, use `pyi-makespec` to generate `.spec` file
* Fix advanced mode fails in some linux platforms
* Support platform `linux.armv6`
* Fix python38 issue: in the wrap mode the footer block isn't executed

5.9.0
-----
pyarmor-webui is published as a separated package, it has been removed from
source package of pyarmor. Now it's a full feature webui, and could be installed
by `pip install pyarmor-webui`.

* Support environment variable `PYARMOR_HOME` as one extra path to find the
  `license.lic` of pyarmor. Now the search order is:
    - In the package path of pyarmor
    - `$PYARMOR_HOME/.pyarmor/license.lic`
    - `$HOME/.pyarmor/license.lic`
    - `$USERPROFILE/.pyarmor/license.lic` (Only for Windows)
* In command `licenses` if option `output` is set, do not append extra path
  `licenses` in the final output path
* In command `obfuscate` with option `--exact`, all the scripts list in the
  command line will be taken as entry script.
* The last argument in command `pack` could be a project path or .json file
* Add new option ``--name`` in the command `pack`
* Add new project attribute `license_file`, `bootstrap_code`
* Add new option ``--with-license``, ``--bootstrap`` in the command `config`
* Add new option ``--bootstrap`` in the command `obfuscate`
* The options ``--package-runtime`` doesn't support `2` and `3`, use
  ``--bootstrap=2`` or ``--bootstrap=3`` instead
* For command `licenses` the generated license could be printed to stdout by
  setting the option ``--output`` to `stdout`

5.8.9
-----
* Fix cross platform issue for vs2015.x86 and vs2015.x86_64
* In command `config` add option ``--advanced`` as alias of ``--advanced-mode``

5.8.8
-----
* Fix issue: the obfuscated scripts will crash when importing the
  packages obfuscated with advanced mode by other registered pyarmor

5.8.7
-----
In this version, the scripts could be obfuscated with option ``--enable-suffix``,
then the name of the runtime package and builtin functions will be unique. By
this way the scripts obfuscated by different capsule could run in the same
Python interpreter.

For example, the bootstrap code may like this with suffix `_vax_000001`::

    from pytransform_vax_000001 import pyarmor_runtime
    pyarmor_runtime(suffix="_vax_000001")

Refer to

  Related target platforms `armv5, android.aarch64, ppc64le, ios.arm64, freebsd, alpine, alpine.arm, poky-i586`

5.7.0
-----
There are 2 major changes in this version:

1. The runtime files are saved in the separated folder `pytransform` as package::

    dist/
        obf_foo.py

        pytransform/
            __init__.py
            license.lic
            pytransform.key
            ...

**Upgrade notes**:

* If you have generated new runtime file "license.lic", it should be copied to
  `dist/pytransform` other than `dist/`

* If you'd like to save the runtime files in the same folder with obfuscated
  scripts as before, obfuscating the scripts with option `package-runtime` like
  this::

    pyarmor obfuscate --package-runtime=0 foo.py
    pyarmor build --package-runtime=0

2. The bootstrap code must be in the obfuscated scripts, and it must be entry
   script as obfuscating.

**Upgrade notes**:

* If you have inserted bootstrap code into the obfuscated script `dist/foo.py`
  which is obfuscated but not as entry script manually. Do it by this command
  after v5.7.0::

    pyarmor obfuscate --no-runtime --exact foo.py

* If you need insert bootstrap code into plain script, first obfuscate an empty
  script like this::

    echo "" > pytransform_bootstrap.py
    pyarmor obfuscate --no-runtime --exact pytransform_bootstrap.py

  Then import `pytransform_bootstrap` in the plain script.

Other changes:

* Change default value of project attribute `package_runtime` from 0 to 1

-----
* Fix `pyarmor-webui` start issue in some cases:  can't import name '_project'

5.6.1
-----
* The command `download` will check the version of dynamic library to
  be sure it works with the current PyArmor.

5.6.0
-----
In this version, new `private capsule`, which use 2048 bits RSA key to
improve security for obfucated scripts, is introduced for purchased
users. All the trial versions still use one same `public capsule`
which use 1024 bits RSA keys. After purchasing PyArmor, a keyfile
which includes license key and `private capsule` will be sent to
customer by email.

For the previous purchased user, the old private capsules which are
generated implicitly by PyArmor after registered PyArmor still work,
but maybe not supported later. Contact jondy.zhao@gmail.com if you'd
like to use new `private capsule`.

The other changes:

* Command `register` are refined according to new private capsule

**Upgrade Note for Previous Users**

There are 2 solutions:

1. Still use old license code.

It's recommanded that you have generated some customized "license.lic"
for the obfuscated scrips and these "license.lic" files have been
issued to your customers. If use new key file, all the previous
"license.lic" does not work, you need generate new one and resend to
your customers.

Actually the command `pip install --upgrade pyarmor` does not overwrite the
purchased license code, you need not run command `pyarmor register` again. It
should still work, you can check it by run `pyarmor -v`.

Or in any machine in which old version pyarmor is running, compress the
following 2 files to one archive "pyarmor-regfile.zip":

* license.lic, which locates in the installed path of pyarmor
* .pyarmor_capsule.zip, which locates in the user HOME path

Then register this keyfile in the new version of pyarmor

    pyarmor register pyarmor-regfile.zip

2. Use new key file.

It's recommanded that you have not yet issued any customized "license.lic" to
your customers.

Forward the purchased email received from MyCommerce to jondy.zhao@gmail.com,
and the new key file will be sent to the registration email. If pyarmor license
is purchased after 2017-10-10, no fee for this upgrading. Before 2017-10-10,
please purchase a new license for latest pyarmor.

5.5.7
-----

  pyarmor isn't trial version.
* In command `licenses`, the output path of generated license file is truncated
  if the registration code is too long, and all the invalid characters for path
  are removed.

5.5.0
-----
* Fix issue: Warning: code object xxxx isn't wrapped (#59)
* Refine command `download`, fix some users could not download library file from pyarmor.dashingsoft.com
* Introduce advanced mode for x86/x64 arch, it has some limitations in trial version
* Add option ``--advanced`` for command `obfuscate`
* Add new property `advanced_mode` for project

A new feature **Advanced Mode** is introduced in this version. In this mode the
structure of PyCode_Type is changed a little to improve the security. And a hook
also is injected into Python interpreter so that the modified code objects could
run normally. Besides if some core Python C APIs are changed unexpectedly, the
obfuscated scripts in advanced mode won't work. Because this feature is highly
depended on the machine instruction set, it's only available for x86/x64 arch
now. And pyarmor maybe makes mistake if Python interpreter is compiled by old
gcc or some other `C` compiles. It's welcome to report the issue if Python
interpreter doesn't work in advanced mode.

Take this into account, the advanced mode is disabled by default. In order to
enable it, pass option ``--advanced`` to command `obfuscate`. But in next minor
version, this mode may be enable by default.

**Upgrade Notes**:

Before upgrading, please estimate Python interpreter in product environments to
be sure it works in advanced mode. Here is the guide

https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor-core/tree/v5.3.0/tests/advanced_mode/README.md

It is recommended to upgrade in the next minor version.

Pyarmor v3.4 introduces a group new commands. For a simple package,
use command **obfuscate** to obfuscate scripts directly. For
complicated package, use Project to manage obfuscated scripts.

Project includes 2 files, one configure file and one project
capsule. Use manifest template string, same as MANIFEST.in of Python
Distutils, to specify the files to be obfuscated.

To create a project, use command **init**, use command **info** to
show project information. **config** to update project settings, and
**build** to obfuscate the scripts in the project.

Other commands, **benchmark** to metric performance, **hdinfo** to
show hardware information, so that command **licenses** can generate
license bind to fixed machine.

All the old commands **capsule**, **encrypt**, **license** are
deprecated, and will be removed from v4.

A new document [src/user-guide.md](src/user-guide.md) is written for
this new version.

3.3.1
-----
* Remove unused files in distribute package

3.3.0
-----
In this version, new obfuscate mode 7 and 8 are introduced. The main
difference is that obfuscated script now is a normal python file (.py)
other than compiled script (.pyc), so it can be used as common way.

Refer to https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor/blob/v3.3.0/src/mechanism.md

-----
* Fix issue: the traceback of an exception contains the name "<pytransform>" instead of the correct module name
* Fix issue: All the constant, co_names include function name, variable name etc still are in clear text.
  Refer to https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor/issues/5

3.2.0
-----
From this version, a new obfuscation mode is introduced. By this way,
